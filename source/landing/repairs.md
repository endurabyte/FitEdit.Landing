<h2>Instructions</h2>

Attach your file to the email, and include in the email body a description of
the problem and the name of the device that created the file.

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>We'll get back to you as soon as we can. Response times vary. We can't make guarantees about response time.</p>

<p>We'll make a best-effort attempt to fix the problem, such as power drops, heart rate spikes, GPS glitches, or other problems. We'll also try to help you get rejected files uploaded to Garmin Connect, Strava, Training Peaks, or other services.</p>

<p>Please note that not all data is recoverable.</p>

<h2>File Formats</h2>

<p>We support any file format that FitEdit can load. Currently that include Garmin FIT fit files. We can also look at TCX and GPX files.</p>
