<h1>Free Repairs</h1>

<span style="text-align: center;">
<p>Welcome to our free training data repair service.</p>
<p>To send us a file, use the button below.</p>
</span>

<a class="cta-button" href="mailto:support@fitedit.io">Send a File</a>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Attach one file to the email, and include in the email body a description of
the problem and the name of the device that created the file. Example device names include "Garmin Forerunner 235" and "Suunto Peak 5".
</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>We'll make a best-effort attempt to fix the problem. Example fixes include power drops, heart rate spikes, and GPS glitches. If you state that the file won't upload to Garmin Connect, Strava, Training Peaks, or another service, we'll try to make it uploadable.</p>

<p>The repair process is manual. We'll get back to you as soon as we can. We can't make guarantees about response time. We reserve the right to not repair a file.</p>

<p>Please note that not all data is recoverable.</p>

<h2>File Formats</h2>

<p>We support any file format that FitEdit can load. Currently that includes Garmin FIT files. We can also work with TCX and GPX files.</p>
