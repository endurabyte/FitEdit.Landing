title: FitEdit Public Release
---

Have you ever uploaded a workout, for example to Garmin Connect, Strava, or TrainingPeaks, and wished you could edit that data?

Then I have good news for you. 

Yesterday, I released the first public version of FitEdit.

With FitEdit, you can change the data behind the online charts and tables. You can modify the second-by-second data including pace, heart rate, GPS latitude and longitude, timestamps, cadence, power, and many other fields. You can even change which device was used! 

Try FitEdit today. It's free to import, view, and edit your data. 

To import files, you can import them from your computer, and you can sync them from Garmin Connect.

To export files, you can set up a payment in the app.

FitEdit is still early in development. There's more to come! To be the first to know, be sure to sign up for email list. 

Do drop me a note and let me know how you're using it or how FitEdit can be even better for you.

Cheers,

Doug
