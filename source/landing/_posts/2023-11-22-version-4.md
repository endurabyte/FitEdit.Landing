Fellow FitEdit fans,

I've got two updates for you.

First, FitEdit 4.0 is released. This version adds the ability to download activity files from Garmin devices. Simply plug in your Garmin watch into your computer with the USB cord. After a short delay, the app detects the watch and offers to import recent activities. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Second, the FitEdit Chrome and Firefox browser extensions are now available. The extensions make it easy to stay signed in to Garmin Connect from within the app. [Learn more](https://www.fitedit.io/support/garmin-signin.html).
